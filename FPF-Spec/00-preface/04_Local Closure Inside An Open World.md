FPF assumes an open world. New evidence can arrive. A better mathematical model may appear. A source publication, source-use record, or telemetry relation may become stale. A competitor may change the state of the art. A user need may shift. A new concern may reveal that the same system should be described differently.

Engineering and management still need local closure. A bridge cannot wait for all possible facts. A gate decision cannot cite the entire universe. A release, experiment, procurement, safety case, or architecture review therefore defines what counts as sufficient for the next action.

The old open-world versus closed-world distinction is a useful didactic picture. In an open world, absence of proof is not proof of absence. If a name is missing from a party guest list, the list may be incomplete. In a locally closed operational world, absence from the accepted manifest matters. If a name is missing from the aircraft manifest, the airline acts as if that passenger is not on the flight.

FPF does not transform the open world into a closed one. It lets a project build small closed worlds for declared purposes:

- a bounded context states which meanings and invariants are current;
- an EntityOfConcern states what project entity the reasoning is about;
- a description states what can be relied on and under what relation;
- evidence and assurance state what claim is credible enough for the local use;
- a gate or decision states what boundary is crossed;
- a reopen condition states when local closure is no longer enough.

This is why FPF patterns often look strict. The strictness is local. It lets a project act while keeping the wider world open. A local closure is not a claim that nothing else exists. It is a declared scope for responsible action.
